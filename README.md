# COMBO

Combo is a library for Constrained Online Multi-variate Bandit Optimization (COMBO). It is used to optimize software with user data in a production environment. Using it requires three steps: 

1. Create a [feature model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_model).
2. Map the model to your actual software features.
3. Create a Combo optimizer

Combo is written in Kotlin with Java/JavaScript interoperability in mind, thus it can be used from both Java and JavaScript.
